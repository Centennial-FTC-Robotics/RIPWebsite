                <ul>
                    <li>An object in OOP (Object Oriented Programming) is just an abstract container for data.</li>
                    <li>A class in OOP represents a certain structure that objects must conform to by specifying special variables called fields, which are associated with that object. Additionally, a class can also specify functions that act on these data, called methods.</li>
                    <li>Classes can also contain variables and functions that belong to themselves, you'll learn how to do that in the next two chapters.</li>
                    <li>Classes are essential in Java and are used for a wide variety of purposes. While the most common usage is to represent a concrete data type, they can also be used to represent the entry point of a program, a container for functions, and much more.</li>
                    <li>In most cases, there will be one class per Java file. Note that the file name must be the same as the name of the class.</li>
                    <li>The basic class declaration looks like this:
                        <div class="code-wrapper"><code>
                            // ClassName.java <br>
                            public class ClassName { <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;// ... <br>
                            }
                        </code></div>
                    The above statement creates an empty class, which isn't really that useful in of itself. However, it will serve as the base to everything else we do. Also, don't worry about the public keyword, we'll cover it very soon after. Just remember to include it for now.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </span>
        </section>
    </main>
