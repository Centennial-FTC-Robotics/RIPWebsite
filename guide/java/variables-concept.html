            <h1 class="title">Variables Part 1</h1>
            <p>A very important concept in programming in general is the idea of variables. They are like boxes that can hold different values. If you know languages like JavaScript, C, or Python, you'll probably be familiar with this concept. Unfortunately, Java does things a little differently. Instead of allowing you to directly use variables, Java uses a programming paradigm called Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in which variables and functions belong to either an object or a class. In the next chapter we'll learn what they are.</p>
