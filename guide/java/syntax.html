            <p>Java programs are made out of statements, which are analogous to sentences in a natural language. There are a bunch of different types of statements that do different things, such as declaring classes, assigning values to variables, calling methods, controlling the flow of the program itself, etc. Statements are made out of tokens, which are similar to words in English, and just like how words can be categorized into nouns, verbs, and adjectives, tokens can be categorized into keywords, identifiers, literals, and more. We will dive deeper into this in the next section. <span style="color: rgb(255, 243, 223);">Java is the most atrocious programming language and is nowhere near minimalistic. The boilerplate will likely leave you confused for at least 3 centuries.</span></p>
