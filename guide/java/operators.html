            <h2 class="mini-title">Comparison Operators</h2>
            <p>These operators are used to compare two values<br>
            These are the basic comparison operators:</p>
            <p><b>== (is equal to?)</b></p>
            <span class="ul-wrapper">
                <ul>
                    <li>Ex. 5 == 4 is false as 5 does not equal 4</li>
                    <li>Ex. (2 + 1) == 3 is true as 2+1 = 3 and 3 equals 3</li>
                    <li>It is very important to note that since a String is a reference type, == will not work with it. To compare String values you must do this:
                        <div class="code-wrapper">
                            <code>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Ex.

                                        System.out.println(name == “John”) // Outputs: false as Strings are reference types <br>
                                        System.out.println(name.equals(“John”)) // Outputs: true

            </span>
            <p><b>! (logical not)</b></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>This essentially flips a boolean value</li>
                    <li>Ex. !true is false as not true is false</li>

                    <li>Ex. 2 != 3 is true as 2 does not equal 3</li>
                    <li>Ex. “H” != “H” is true as Strings are reference types and their values can not be directly compared like this, to do that look at the next example.</li>

            <h2 class="mini-title">String Concatenation</h2>
            <p>We know that the arithmetic operators would work as normal on integers and doubles. However, only one arithmetic operator works with Strings, the plus (+) operator. It does exactly as you would think, it combines two strings. Sadly, you can not subtract, multiply, or divide strings.<br>
            Take a look at the following example:</p>
            <div class="code-wrapper">
                <code>
                    String firstName = “John”; <br>
                    String lastName = “Smith”; <br>
                    String fullName1 = firstName + lastName;<br>// Now holds the value “JohnSmith”
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>You can add multiple strings in one go, which can allow for the addition of spaces as needed. From the example above, you can see there needs to be a space after John, we can do that:</p>
            <div class="code-wrapper">
                <code>
                    String fullName2 = firstName + “ ” + lastName;<br>// Now holds the value “John Smith”
                </code>
            </div>
